# Imports
# random and pathlib are parts of the Python Standard Library, basically core features of the language
# random is a library for generating pseudo-random numbers, with all kinds of distributions, ranges etc
# pathlib is basically a better way to deal with file paths (because file paths can be a mess, Windows vs Unix different formats, relative vs absolute paths etc
# the "from XYZ import ABC" notation basically means that we are only important one class or function or something from the library
# pygame is the one library that needs to be installed with pip, it is not part of the Python Standard Library
import random
from pathlib import Path
import pygame

# and finally config is my own file, config.py which is just kinda poorly named file with constants and whatnot
import config

### INITIALIZATION
# Create the main window and set it to have desired width and height, the double brackets are here because pygame.display.set_mode expects a tuple
# Tuple is basically a pair of two variables, look it up if you want
# Alternatively it could be in two lines like this:
# windows_size_tuple = (config.WINDOW_WIDTH, config.WINDOW_HEIGHT)
# MAIN_WINDOW = pygame.display.set_mode(windows_size_tuple)
MAIN_WINDOW = pygame.display.set_mode((config.WINDOW_WIDTH, config.WINDOW_HEIGHT))

## Changing the window title to the desired text (string)
pygame.display.set_caption(config.CAPTION_STRING)

## Directories
# Path().absolute() basically creates a Path objects (used to handling file paths) and gets its absolute path, so in this case the path to the directory the
# script runs in, you can print it to see, like print(BASE_DIR)
root_dir_path = Path()

# This is a Pathlib way of joining two paths, from say "C:/Wow/Elite" to "C:/Wow/Elite/Assets"
assets_dir_path = root_dir_path / 'Assets'

## Load and setup image assets
# Whoa, a lot is happening on this line 44. Two function calls (pygame.transform.scale() and pygame.image.load(). Start from the inside, we are calling
# image.load with just one parameter â€“ a path to file, kinda like this pygame.image.load("C:/Wow/Elite/picture.png") but we are being fancy about it and are
# combining the path in place there, from three elements - use the assets directory path, look for Sprites subdirectory and in there, grab the png
# this function loads the image and returns object of Surface type (this is pygame stuff), which is what the image.scale() function wants as its input
# So we are dumping output of the load function into the scale function, which also takes another Tuple - heigh and width it should scale the image to
# The result is another Surface, which we will use in the actual game to show on screen, we just needed to load and resize iz
# This is done with all the images

player_spaceship_img = pygame.transform.scale(pygame.image.load(assets_dir_path / 'Sprites' / 'player_spaceship_blue_cruiser.png'),
                                              (config.PLAYER_WIDTH, config.PLAYER_HEIGHT))
# Notice that I did not put he bullet size in config yet, so it is hardcoded
player_bullet_img = pygame.transform.scale(pygame.image.load(assets_dir_path / 'Sprites' / 'bullet_basic_blue.png'),

## Change the default pygame icon to a nice MaSu icon
program_icon = pygame.image.load((assets_dir_path / 'icon.png'))
