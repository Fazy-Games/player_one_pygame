1
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
A misfit to this space

2
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:37,024
no religion no real place

3
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:39,848
I grow weary of these walls

4
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:42,672
so tired of it all

5
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,496
Dull gray and endless days

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
here where evil has no face

7
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:50,944
It is hidden from my eyes

8
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,476
unseen or in disguise

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,400
Welcome to a world

10
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,925
where you always get the girl

11
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,833
You may lose a fight or two

12
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,857
but you'll win if you get through

13
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,281
Face up and challenge all

14
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,956
you ever knew since you could crawl

15
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,807
Always looking somewhere else

16
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:16,694
when it's all inside yourself

17
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,481
I wanna play until I die

18
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,955
don't wanna lose my reasons why

19
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,343
I race towards the sky

20
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:27,763
in a world that never ends

21
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:30,303
I keep coming back for more

22
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:33,438
keep coming back until I score

23
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:36,426
always stronger than before

24
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,192
in a world that never ends
